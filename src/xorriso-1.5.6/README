README for xorriso in PVMK appsdk
Bryan E. Topp <betopp@betopp.com> 2025

This is a stripped-down version of the "xorriso" utility from the GNU Project.

It is used to build ISO9660-compliant filesystems. The PVMK application SDK includes support for such filesystems, as the backing for its stdio and fcntl components.

Most examples in the PVMK application SDK require this utility to build; if your system does not provide it, this copy will work.
