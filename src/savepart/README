README for savepart directory

These files are savegame filesystems that can be written to a game card. They are in "PFS" format, as used by the PVMK system for writable filesystems.

They have 8MBytes of zeroes at the end, to make sure there's room for the write-ahead journal on the card. Note that the journal is actually placed at the end of the card, though, and not immediately following the filesystems.

To use one of these filesystems, append it at the next 4K block after the ISO image for the game.

Note that they must start at 4096-byte alignment, even though ISO images may end on 2048-byte alignment. If the ISO image stops at 2048 but not 4096 byte alignment, then leave 2048 bytes between the ISO and PFS images.
