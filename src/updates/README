README for neki_upd.tar

This directory contains the official Neki32 System Updates package, neki_upd.tar.

It contains the latest System Software for each variant of the Neki32 console.

Include this in your game card and reference it with an El Torito boot entry, using platform ID 0x22.

The Neki32 will find this on boot and prompt the user to update, if the package contains a newer system software for their console.
