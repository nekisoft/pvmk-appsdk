README for sdlsc
Bryan E. Topp <betopp@betopp.com> 2024

This is the SDL System-Call Shim library, "sdlsc".

It can be used to build an otherwise PVMK-focused application, on a normal desktop.

The sdlsc library contains an "sc.h" header that is used in place of the normal "sc.h" system-call header.

It contains a C source file, "sdlsc.c", which implements the functions in this header.

Together, this provides an implementation of the PVMK audio/video/input system calls, on top of SDL.
